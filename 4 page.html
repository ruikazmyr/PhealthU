<p >"<u>The word <b>cerebrovascular </b>is made up of two parts â€“<b><i> "cerebro"</b></i> which refers to <i>the large part of the brain</i>, and<b><i> "vascular" </b></i>which means <i>arteries and veins. </i>Together, the word cerebrovascular refers to <b>blood flow in the brain.</b> The term <b>cerebrovascular disease</b> includes <i>all disorders in which an area of the brain is temporarily or permanently affected by ischemia or bleeding and one or more of the cerebral blood vessels are involved in the pathological process. </i>Cerebrovascular disease includes stroke, carotid stenosis, vertebral stenosis and intracranial stenosis, aneurysms, and vascular malformations.</u>" <b>-accordinng to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. </b></p>

<br><br>
<p>"<u>Cerebrovascular disease refers to a <i>group of conditions that affect <b>blood flow</b> and <b>the blood vessels</b> in the brain.</i> Problems with blood flow may occur from <b>blood vessels narrowing</b><i> (stenosis)</i>, <b>clot formation</b><i> (thrombosis),</i><b> artery blockage</b><i> (embolism)</i>, or<b> blood vessel rupture</b> <i>(hemorrhage).</i></u>" <b>-according to The University of Michigan Health</b>

<p>Cerebrovascular Disease is the loss of blood flow in the part of the brain which damages brain tissues. This leads to the lack of sufficient blood flow. The Lack of sufficient blood flow; also referred to as ischemia, affects brain tissue and may cause a stroke. Strokes are dangerous as it can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or sometimes even death as it is a serious life-threatining medical condition. </p>

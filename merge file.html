<p> &quot;<u>Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of your <i>lungs</i>. It causes the air sacs of your lungs to fill up <i>with fluid or pus</i>. Pneumonia can range <i>from mild to severe,</i> depending on what <i>caused it, your age, and your overall health</i>.</u>&quot; <b>-according to MedlinePlus,</b><br/>
<br/>&quot;<u>Pneumonia <i>can be very serious and can cause death</i>. Complications from pneumonia include <i>respiratory failure, sepsis and lung abscess</i> and are more likely to affect <i>older adults</i>, young children, those with a <i>weakened immune system and people with other medical problems</i>. <b>Good health habits can fight pneumonia</b>.</u>&quot; <b>- According to lung.org</b>
</p>
<p> So in basic words, Pneumonia is an inffection in the lungs. It can be mild to severe meaning that depends on the cause, age, and just your health in general; it can be mild meaning little or not that bing ir severe meaning strong. It can cause death.

<align=center><img alt="Diabetes Mellitus" height="200px" src="C:\Users\faridah\Desktop\sITTIE fATMaH stufff\ICT\website\diabetes2-1-1.webp" width="600px"/>

<p>&quot;<u><b><i>Diabetes mellitus</b> (DM) is a metabolic disease</i>, involving inappropriately elevated blood glucose levels. DM has several categories, including type 1, type 2, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), gestational diabetes, neonatal diabetes, and secondary causes due to endocrinopathies, steroid use, etc.</u>&quot;<b>-According to National institute of health (NIH) (.gov)</b><br/>

<br/>&quot;<u>Diabetes mellitus is <b><i>the scientific name for diabetes</i></b>, but it is more commonly known simply as diabetes. It&apos;s when your body <i>can&apos;t produce enough of a hormone called insulin</i>, or the insulin it produces isn&apos;t effective.</u>&quot; <b>-according to the Diabetes.org.uk </b><br/>

<br/>&quot;<u>Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.<b><i> Insulin </b>is a hormone that regulates blood glucose.</i></u>&quot; <b>- According to the World health Organization (WHO)</b>
</p>

<p> If you were wondering, <i>yes it is just diabetes. It&apos;s just its scientific name is Diabetes Mellitus. </i>I&apos;m sure it&apos;s alreadty self eplainatory to you as you&apos;ve just read that it is when your body can&apos;t produce enough of insulin. Insulin is just basically <i>an essential hormone</i>. It helps your body turn food into energy and manages your blood sugar levels. <i>And then  your body will <b>break down its own fat and muscle</b>, resulting in<b> weight loss.</b></i> After then lead to a serious<i> short-term condition called <b>diabetic ketoacidosis.</b></i>

<h2 style="background-color: gray;">3. Cerebrovascular diseases</h2>
<align=center><img alt="neoplasms or cancer" height="200px" src="C:\Users\faridah\Desktop\sITTIE fATMaH stufff\ICT\website\Cerebrovascular diseases.jfif" width="600px"/>

<p>&quot;<u>The word <b>cerebrovascular </b>is made up of two parts –<b><i> &quot;cerebro&quot;</b></i> which refers to <i>the large part of the brain</i>, and<b><i> &quot;vascular&quot; </b></i>which means <i>arteries and veins. </i>Together, the word cerebrovascular refers to <b>blood flow in the brain.</b> The term <b>cerebrovascular disease</b> includes <i>all disorders in which an area of the brain is temporarily or permanently affected by ischemia or bleeding and one or more of the cerebral blood vessels are involved in the pathological process. </i>Cerebrovascular disease includes stroke, carotid stenosis, vertebral stenosis and intracranial stenosis, aneurysms, and vascular malformations.</u>&quot; <b>-accordinng to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. </b></p>

<br/><br/>
<p>&quot;<u>Cerebrovascular disease refers to a <i>group of conditions that affect <b>blood flow</b> and <b>the blood vessels</b> in the brain.</i> Problems with blood flow may occur from <b>blood vessels narrowing</b><i> (stenosis)</i>, <b>clot formation</b><i> (thrombosis),</i><b> artery blockage</b><i> (embolism)</i>, or<b> blood vessel rupture</b> <i>(hemorrhage).</i></u>&quot; <b>-according to The University of Michigan Health</b>
</p>

<br/>

<p>Cerebrovascular Disease is the loss of blood flow in the part of the brain which damages brain tissues. This leads to the lack of sufficient blood flow. The Lack of sufficient blood flow; also referred to as ischemia, affects brain tissue and may cause a stroke. Strokes are dangerous as it can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or sometimes even death as it is a serious life-threatining medical condition. </p>

<align=center><img alt="neoplasms or cancer" height="200px" src="C:\Users\faridah\Desktop\sITTIE fATMaH stufff\ICT\website\Neoplasms or cancer.jfif" width="600px"/>

<h3> Neoplasms</h3>
<p>&quot;<u>Neoplasms may be <b>benign <i>(not cancer)</i></b> or <b>malignant <i>(cancer).</b> </i><b>Benign neoplasms</b> may grow large but <i>do not spread into</i>, or invade, nearby tissues or other parts of the body. <b>Malignant neoplasms</b> <i> can spread into</i>, or invade, nearby tissues. They can also spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems. <i>Also called <b>tumor</b></i>.</u>&quot; <b>- according to National Cancer Institute  of the United States</b></p>

<br/><br/>

<p>&quot;<u>Overview. When reading about health topics, you might come across the word <b><i>“neoplasm,”</b></i> which is actually<i> another word for tumor.</i> A tumor is <i>a mass made up of cells that have divided abnormally.</i> While being diagnosed with a neoplasm or tumor sounds ominous, it&apos;s important to know that <i>not all are cancerous.</i></u>&quot;<b> -according to Yale Medicine</b></p>

<br/><br/>

<p>Neoplasm can  spread to other parts of your body through the blood and lymph systems. Also called tumor. This is through something called metastasis. In  metastasim, cencer cells break away from where theuy were,  then travel through the blood or lymph system. This then results to forming of new tumors in some parts of the body. This is a fatal  disease if, if not treated to treatment. But as stated there by the Yale Medicine, not all  neoplasms are cancerous but you still should keep on checkups to make sure you are safe and eat healthy so that we can avoid this.   </p>

<h3>Cancer</h3>
<p>&quot;<u>Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. 
<br/>
<br/>
Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.</u>&quot; <b>-according to National Cancer Institute of the United States</b></p>

<br/>

<p>Cancer. One of the leadinng cause of death in the world. Second cause in of death in the Philippines and secon-leading cause of death in the world. Cancer, when we hear it think about death. It is very Fatal disease that doesn&apos;t have any cure but there are treatments for  it.  Canncer can start anywhere in the body and itis made of trillions of cells.  Cancer cell are those cells that divide uncontrolable and innvade nearby tissues. They are abnormal cells. Since it has no cure and has a vast percent of fatality, we should avoid and prevent it as much as possible. We can do this by eating healthy, be active physically, don&apos;t smoke, lessen alcohol, check ups and so much more.</p>

<align=center><img alt=" Ischaemic heart diseases pic" height="200px" src="C:\Users\faridah\Desktop\sITTIE fATMaH stufff\ICT\website\Coronary-heart-disease.jpg" width="600px"/>

<p>&quot;<u>An ischemic stroke is when there’s some kind of<i> blockage</i> that keeps blood from <i>reaching all areas of your brain.</i> <i><u>The areas without blood flow stop working and start to die.</i></u> If blood flow doesn’t return quickly enough, an ischemic stroke <i>will cause permanent brain damage or even death.</i> This is a medical emergency that <b><i>needs immediate care.</i></b></u>&quot;<b> -According to Cleveland Clinic</b></p>

<br/><br/>

<p>&quot;<u>Ischemic heart disease refers to heart weakening caused by reduced blood flow to your heart. Typically, this reduced blood flow is the result of coronary artery disease, a condition that occurs when your coronary arteries narrow. Ischemic heart disease may also be called cardiac ischemia or ischemic cardiomyopathy.</u>&quot; <b>- according to advocate Health</b>
</p>

<br/>

<p>So according to multiple reliable sources, an ischemic stroke there is something blocking the bloods from reaching full areas of your brain. And when this happens, consiquences can follow. This may even cause death.

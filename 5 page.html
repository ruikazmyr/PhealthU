<h3> Neoplasms</h3>
<p>"<u>Neoplasms may be <b>benign <i>(not cancer)</i></b> or <b>malignant <i>(cancer).</b> </i><b>Benign neoplasms</b> may grow large but <i>do not spread into</i>, or invade, nearby tissues or other parts of the body. <b>Malignant neoplasms</b> <i> can spread into</i>, or invade, nearby tissues. They can also spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems. <i>Also called <b>tumor</b></i>.</u>" <b>- according to National Cancer Institute  of the United States</b></p>

<p>"<u>Overview. When reading about health topics, you might come across the word <b><i>“neoplasm,”</b></i> which is actually<i> another word for tumor.</i> A tumor is <i>a mass made up of cells that have divided abnormally.</i> While being diagnosed with a neoplasm or tumor sounds ominous, it's important to know that <i>not all are cancerous.</i></u>"<b> -according to Yale Medicine</b></p>

<p>Neoplasm can  spread to other parts of your body through the blood and lymph systems. Also called tumor. This is through something called metastasis. In  metastasim, cencer cells break away from where theuy were,  then travel through the blood or lymph system. This then results to forming of new tumors in some parts of the body. This is a fatal  disease if, if not treated to treatment. But as stated there by the Yale Medicine, not all  neoplasms are cancerous but you still should keep on checkups to make sure you are safe and eat healthy so that we can avoid this.   </p>

<br>
<br>
Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.</u>" <b>-according to National Cancer Institute of the United States</b></p>
